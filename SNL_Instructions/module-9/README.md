## Publish

All content will become publicly accessible via IBM COS, please check out the [section](#section) below how to get the public url to the resource.

## Links to your content

To use your content you are going to need a publicly accessible url (link). This link is created every time you merge your content in to master branch and it points to your content in the IBM Cloud Object Storage. You will find links to every piece of your content in the GitLab Page for your project. You will find your project's GitLab Page by going to the `Settings > Pages` menu or by using the this url  `<https://ibm-skills-network.gitlab.io/quicklabs/<project_name>`.
